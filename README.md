# Explanation of the structure of the proyect

Although the structure of the project is not a single answer question and that the structure will probably depend on the project itself, the methodology we are currently using and the number of members that are part of the dev team among other important things that will determine the structure of the project we could say that there are some common guidelines so i used that one to this proyect structure.

- Components: Main features or big components that are will be the kickoff of the child components(generic/shared ones) that the proyect will have. Are the basic building block of the application, the idea of this one is that they could be used all over the application for a specific reason but with differents props. 

  - Note: Components will have the following structure:
    * Component: The React component itself.
    * Styles: where the styles are exported.
    * Tests: React Testing library/Jest tests. // To be implemented in the future

- Utils: Extra utils folder where you could find:
  - Constants: Constants used to avoid hardcoded strings that are shared among the components and also if in the future the string changes we will need just to uploaded in a single line MR.
  - Colours: Shared colours used by saas.
  - Font: Font family (Roboto) and font weights
  - Screen: Screen sizes used in media queries around the application css styles.
